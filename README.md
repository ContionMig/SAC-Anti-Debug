# SAC-Anti-Debug

[[My Website]](https://theherobrine9.wixsite.com/website/)

# Important
This is a project which i made quite a long time ago to somewhat "support" my SAC development. You can use this for anything else you like, however make sure to use other methods as well, things like Packers and Code obfuscation. With help from packers and obfuscations, this is quite useful and helpful.

# TO-DO
- Make it more secure

# Helpers
- https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser/tree/master/al-khaser/Anti%20Debug

# Notes

Make sure to update some stuff and make it more secure. Also, this is only for 32 bit.
